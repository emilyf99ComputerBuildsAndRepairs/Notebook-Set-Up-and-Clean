# Notebook-Set-Up-and-Clean

![notebook]()

I was presented with this Notebook by a charity, the charity wanted this machine to run basic tasks and to be used by Young People to make small projects on. 
This machine is an EEE PC from the early 2000's. My normal recommendation for a machine of this age is to retire it and get a new machine, especially considering it is going to be
used by people who aren't technologically minded. However the charity I was doing this for did not have any money at the time to buy a replacement. 

My task was to make the machine suitable for use. I was informed there was already a copy of Windows 7 installed and that must remain and be authenicated. In the age of machine I 
would normally recommend installing a Linux Distribution as older editions of Windows can be known to have many security flaws. However I had to meet the clients request so 
Windows 7 remained.

After ensuring that the machine booted my first port of call was to take the machine apart. I decided to do this due to the condition of the machine and a unpleasent odor coming
from the machine when the fan was in use. 

The first stage or taking this device apart was to pry the keyboard away. This is done by pressing four metal tabs along the top of the keyboard with a screwdriver. Care should be
taken here to avoid snagging the ribbon cable underneath.

Once removed, I then undid all the screws in the back of the notebook and pried apart the sides to remove the top of the notebook and expose the internals.

To check on the fan condition and the processor condition I removed the left half of the components as access is on the bottom of the left board. I inspected these components as 
this machine has never been in parts previously so I predicted some dirt build up or degrading of the cooling system. I removed any physical dirt in the fan and then removed the heat sink. This notebook uses thermal pads rather than paste and luckily for me these pads had not degraded. Therefore I put the machine back together after cleaning and started
working on the machines set up.

Once turned on I set up the machine to have an admin user and a normal user, this was to minimise the damage that could be caused by users on the machine. I then added anti-virus 
to the machine. This was Avast. Usually I do not personally recommend Avast. However I struggled to find and anti-virus that would run on a machine of such low specifications. I then installed a browser called Pale Moon. This was in the place of FireFox which I uninstalled as Firefox caused machine crashes and poor response time. Pale Moon is a browser that's meant for older machines like this. It is more secure and has better supported than the pre-installed Internet Explorer and is built of an older version of FireFox so it wouldn't be too unfamilar to the user. I then installed Speccy to do some checks on component health. I then added some useful shortcuts for the client and added a password to the admin account as well as a standard user account. I then added final touches such as backgrounds and user profile images.

Before returning the device the last check I did was HDD health. I was convinced that the drive in this machine was the original, usually in this scenario I would recommend swapping to an SSD for better reliabilty, better performance and a quieter machine. However due to the charity not having any additional funds this was not an option for them unless absolutely neccesary. So instead I defragged the machine and checked it for bad sectors and errors. To ensure the machine was in a good standard before I returned it.

Upon returning the machine the client was happy with the work I did and has not since reported and issues.
